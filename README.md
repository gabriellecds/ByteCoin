# ByteCoin 

The aim of this challenge is to apply the skills I learned in the Weather tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. I revisited how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing. This was the most advanced challenge I've faced so far on this iOS development journey. 

This app is a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all popular and traded currencies, so you can track the performance of your Bitcoin investments on the go. 

In summary, I practiced the following topics that I had learned in the Weather app: 

* How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions.
* Swift guard keyword.
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
